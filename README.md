# Deep Learning

Solutions for the laborations as part of the Deep Learning course offered at LiU during the spring semester of 2021

## Lab1: Deep Neural Networks

Data used in this laboration are from the Kitsune Network Attack Dataset, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Kitsune+Network+Attack+Dataset . We will focus on the 'Mirai' part of the dataset. The task is to make a DNN that can classify if each attack is benign or malicious.

## Lab2: Convolutional Neural Networks

Images used in this laboration are from CIFAR 10 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10). The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class. The task is to make a classifier, using a convolutional neural network, that can correctly classify each image into the correct class.

## Lab3: Recurrent Neural Networks
